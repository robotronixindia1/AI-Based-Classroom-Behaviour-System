# AI-Based-Classroom-Behaviour-System
This project aims to enhance student engagement and classroom dynamics through AI-driven monitoring and analysis. By processing real-time video data from classroom cameras, the system analyzes student behavior and attentiveness using advanced AI algorithms. Educators are empowered with an intuitive GUI and actionable insights to personalize teaching strategies and intervene when necessary. The platform identifies signs of disengagement or distraction, offering opportunities for timely improvements. It supports tailored instruction for both individual students and groups. Outcomes include improved attentiveness, enriched learning environments, and more effective teaching practices. The system creates a dynamic feedback loop, helping educators continuously adapt and refine their methods. Ultimately, it demonstrates how technology can transform education and instructional strategies for the better.![class](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57f1443-cba2-478e-9b6c-d2d86615c59b)
